# Lumen Gym

This is a static website showcasing a fictional gym called Lumen Gym. It includes three pages: Home, Services, and Contact. It was created as a project for a web development bootcamp, with the goal of showcasing skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and educating proper ways of using Git and GitHub.

## Potential Future Features

While the current version of Lumen Gym is a static website, I have plans to enhance it with additional features in the future. Some potential features that I am considering include:

- Adding a class schedule and online booking system for members
- Improving the website's accessibility and mobile responsiveness to make it more user-friendly for all visitors
- Adding a login system to allow users to create and manage their accounts
- Creating a membership checkout process to facilitate the signup process for new members

I am always open to feedback and suggestions from users, and will continue to work on improving and updating Lumen Gym as needed.
